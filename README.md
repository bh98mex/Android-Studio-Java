# Android-Studio-Java
Small mobile apps.
A number of small mobile apps developed in Android Studio. Each of the apps has a small description.
The only mix is the CourtCounter app. In this specific repository, two apps have merged as one; a Google Map detection app and a 
game score counter app. Their independent functionality has not been affected.
